i do however think there's a small asterisk to this point.然而，我仍旧像标出一个小小的例外

as i think every generation will have a long-running show in that defines that era and goes down as a classic.正如我认为每个年代都会有一个定义本年代并沉淀下来成为经典的长篇动画

[with] they being a staple of gateway anime .随着他们成为入门动画的主力

and this long-running nature allows it far more time to build the popularity and impact and staying power.并且这个长篇动画的特点能让它们通过更多的时间去积攒人气、产生影响并维持霸权

cuz well it sticks around for so long.因为好吧它们太持久了

so if there is an exception to everything i've said here.那么如果我说的东西外有一个例外呢

it would of course be my hero acadamia，那当然就是「我的英雄学院」啦

i do think this is the one show that has done enough to be remembered for a long time to come。我由衷地认为这是一部已经实现能被长远地记住的动画

but i also consider these types of shows to play by a different set of rules than the mob psychos of the anime world。但是我也认为这种动画的类型对比于动画世界中的「灵能百分百」有更为不同的准则

because part of the reason the idea of classics has died is because well　因为有认为经典的想法已死的部分原因是

we don't fell the need to look back into the past 我们并没有回顾过去的迫切需求

even if the past is just a year or two ago 即使这个过去仅仅只有一两年

there's so much to choose from now 我们有太多的选择了

what's the point of looking back 为什么还要回顾过去呢

and thus the real reason i wanted to make this video 这也是我想做这个视频的真正原因

because over the past few month 因为在过去的几个月内

i actually did set a bit of time to watch some classic anime i had never seen before 我花了很多时间去看那些我以前从来没有看过的经典动画

and it just reminded me why classics are indeed called classics这也提醒了我经典为何被称为经典


two months ago i set off on an arduous mission to start the anime that had been sitting on my watch list for years 两个月前我开始了一项艰苦的任务：开始看那些躺在我愿望单好多年的动画

waiting until i was ready to take that leap of faith to finally watch it 那些等着我做足准备尝试去看的动画

Legend of th Galactic Heroes 「银河英雄传说」

it was an undertaking that was as intimidating as the reputation that preceded it  它是一个重大的项目， 就和其先于它的名声一样生畏

a classic so highly spoken of is literally been memed to death by many people myself included其是一个被盛赞的经典，字面意义上的被很多人[模因到死]，包括我

as the one show that's been put up on the highest pedestal 他作为一个动画被放到了最高的基准上

anime won't be the same once you watch Legends of the Galactic Heroes they said他们说一旦你看了「银河英雄传说」，动画就和以前不同了

and with this all in mind 脑中带着这些看法

what i found was exactly what i had expected 最后我也恰好看到了我期待的东西

one of the greatest stories to have been told in the history of anime动画史上最伟大的故事之一

a tale so grand no other anime even comes close to the scale depth and density of the saga told here一个壮丽到没有任何其他动画能在广度深度和质量[密度]上与之相比的故事

a production that took almost ten years to complete contained in a whopping 110 episodes for a one-of-a-kind experience一个花费了10年，有着庞大的110集的独一无二体验的产物

you can't find anywhere else in the medium 在动画这形式中你不可能再找到第二个

it's not the kind of fast-paced instant gratification anime more common today这不是那种现今寻常的快节奏的包爽动画

but a full-length epic you gradually immerse yourself into而是一个你能够慢慢沉浸其中的完整史诗

with a show like this you can get so caught up in this reputation看了这个动画你会被深深地沉浸其中

that it can be easy to forget how and why you've got its reputation in the first place 以至于很容易就会忘记如何和为何一开始会得到它的这个赞誉

through this it reminded me why there used to be this big notion that you should go out and watch the classics通过这个提醒了我为何这里曾有那个概念：你需要出去看经典

not just because it was a great show并非仅仅因为它很伟大

there are plenty of great shows that coming out right now现如今有很多伟大的动画

but because it's a unique experience from anything you can find today更是因为这是一段独特的体验，一段如今无法复制的体验

there's reason the classics have survived the passage of time这就是为何经典不随时间流逝

they might have pioneered something他们也许开拓了什么领域

they might have left a deep impression on the audience of their time他们也许给那时的观众留下了深刻的印象

but most importantly it's because throughout the years that came after 但最重要的是因为经过他们后面这些年

nothing came along that was able to replace them没有新作能够取代他们

i can safely say since i first watched Cowboy Bebop我能自信地说自从我第一次看「星际牛仔」之后

there hasn't been any other show quite like it没有任何其他动画和其相似

serial experiments lain has a depiction of technology 「玲音」有对技术的描写

that somehow seems more relevant today than when it came out in 1998这描写看起来甚至比1998年的时候看起来更有价值

akira still looks better than 90% of the anime coming out now「阿基拉」的观感仍旧比现在9成的新出动画更好

Neon Genesis Evangelion redefined what it means to be [genre-defining]「新世纪福音战士」重新定义了什么是典型定义

it can be easy to forget through the currency of Isekai power fantasy highschool [XXX] of today 很容易就能忘掉现今异世界力量幻想高中XXX的泛滥

that anime didn't always look like this看到动画并非一直如此

so if you think this season is little slow and you[yet] have some time to fill那么如果你认为这季的动画节奏不够明快，而且你还想消磨时间的话

just pick a classic title that's been collecting dust on your watch list只需捡起那些经典正在你愿望单里的吃灰的经典动画吧

and i guarantee it'll be a way more fulfilling experience than watching another disposable show that's been airing in the last year我保证这是一个更让人满足的体验，比起又看一部过去一年中放送的厕纸动画而言

whether or not you agree on which anime consist classics 无论你是同意哪些动画构成经典

or even if you disagree with my opinion that we haven't gotten any recently 或者即使你不同意我说最近没有经典动画的意见

i think it's important to keep the idea of classics alive我觉得保持经典存续的想法很重要

because it does feel like lately there's been a depreciation in the value of longevity and revisiting the past因为确实感觉最近寿命的价值和回顾过去有所降低

so if there's anything i wanted to do with this video所以如果这部视频里有我想做的什么事情

it's reminding people that there is a reason to look back就是提醒人们仍有回顾过去的价值

it's taking a break from the current climate and having a look at product of another time 在现今的气氛下休息一下，看一看其他时间的作品

it's having that realization of 就会有这种认识

oh this is what everyone was talking about这就是当年每个人都在谈论的东西

it's experiencing a show that has done something to deserve to be remembered 这是在体验一个已经做到了一些值得被记住的成就的作品

because one of the saddest things i think it happened to classics is for them to be forgotten 因为我认为对于这些经典来说最悲哀的事情之一莫过于遗忘
