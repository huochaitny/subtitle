3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,979
free-to-play anime style action RPG for

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,509
PC that is available in the link below

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,339
right off the bat got to say that this

6
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:10,479
game honestly is one of the most

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,430
satisfying action combat systems I've

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,830
played in an anime MMO game attacks feel

9
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,510
good and weighty chaining combos with

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,100
special moves that's cool as hell and

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,960
overall battles can actually be quite

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,579
challenging not forgetting that it all

13
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:23,829
looks absolutely beautiful choose from a

14
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,510
variety of different classes to see your

15
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,829
play style and also create your own

16
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,269
character to suit whatever a protagonist

17
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,399
you want to be you can be an Opie anime

18
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,959
guy or let's be honest we're gonna be a

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,759
girl cuz when in life wouldn't I choose

20
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,799
to roleplay as a cute anime girl see you

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,358
can edit all the important features like

22
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,169
eye color hair Stalin currently the game

23
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:42,640
was in early access for North and Latin

24
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,559
America where you can play either PvE or

25
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,689
get your ass handed to you in PvP and

26
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,279
I've been impressed at how closely the

27
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,869
developers are listening to feedback and

28
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,489
quickly addressing any issues the player

29
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,108
base may have had with the game if you

30
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:54,759
want to try it out again click the link

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,229
in the description to give it a download

32
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,288
on Steam and with that said let's get on

33
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:01,149
with the video there's a concept I feel

34
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,158
has died as of late within our community

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,649
one that used to be a standard part of

36
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,289
getting into the medium and that is the

37
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,560
idea around classic anime animes that

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,810
defines their generation and pioneered

39
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,759
the landscape you see today it used to

40
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,349
be mandatory to at least go back and

41
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,149
watch a handful of them but nowadays not

42
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,679
only is there less obligation to get

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,390
yourself cultured by watching these

44
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,308
shows I also kind of feel like no matter

45
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,738
how great any new anime coming out is

46
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:28,269
there's nothing that really sticks tells

47
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,189
me that we could call a modern classic

48
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,378
io handedly mentioned in my best of

49
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,778
anime 2018 video that despite how great

50
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:36,689
I thought last year was it had zero

51
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,590
classics which is more my way of

52
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,238
describing that no matter how good any

53
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,250
show was it seemed like a sense of

54
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,988
impact and longevity that a lot of

55
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,878
greater years of anime had but it

56
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:47,469
certainly sparked an unintentional

57
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,849
debate in the comments section about

58
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,859
what exactly a classic even is and

59
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,049
whether it's too early to judge so today

60
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,878
I wanted to really dig in on that exact

61
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:57,278
topic what's lacking today and really

62
00:01:57,478 --> 00:01:59,890
remind everyone why they were important

63
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,719
in the first place there's a lot of

64
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,948
different things I want to unpack in

65
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,869
this video so without further ado let's

66
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,290
just jump into it what makes a classic

67
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,210
fm I don't think I need to state that

68
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,310
the exact parameters of what defines a

69
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,260
classic is entirely subjective and

70
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,170
probably different for every person but

71
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,270
I guess I just did anyway most common

72
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:20,620
definitions of the word and a broader

73
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,270
sense simply played out to be something

74
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,130
of universally recognized quality and

75
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,230
established ongoing value however for

76
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,210
the sake of the arguments I'm making for

77
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,480
me it boils down to three main points

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,540
number one staying power classics are

79
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,550
classics because they have stood the

80
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,290
test of time no matter how many years

81
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,000
past they will still be relevant in

82
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,160
their own way there are many older anime

83
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,230
that have aged in some way mainly to do

84
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,150
with their art style or animation but

85
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,439
have preserved a sense of timelessness

86
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,360
with either their story or characters

87
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,030
that can be enjoyed in any era as a side

88
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,590
note that have been many shows that set

89
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,780
trends and pioneered legendary tropes on

90
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,310
the bleeding edge of war was fresh and

91
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,320
significant in a time they came out but

92
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,730
I've lost a lot of their luster through

93
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,530
these elements becoming oversaturated

94
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,719
years later the vision of escaflowne for

95
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,520
example pioneered a lot of things and

96
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,200
there was a time it was considered a

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,689
classic and I'm sure many still do now

98
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,219
though it's a lot harder to recommend

99
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,870
for newer audiences as most people who

100
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,400
watch it for the first time could see it

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,380
as some generic ISA KY mecha show

102
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,270
because of how overplayed many of its

103
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,310
tropes have become since and in my

104
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,200
opinion no matter how revolutionary a

105
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,450
show is this is a test it has to

106
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,490
overcome which brings me to point number

107
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,219
two impact I feel there needs to be a

108
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,960
level of impact and influence because

109
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,310
logically you must have been able to

110
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,230
impact in its own time in order for it

111
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,120
to be remembered and this goes in two

112
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,980
ways an impact on the anime industry

113
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,230
itself that influences future titles and

114
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,150
the landscape of anime or an impact on

115
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,740
anime pop culture and the general

116
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,240
audience of the time I don't think I

117
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,920
need to clarify what kind of impact

118
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,080
anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion or

119
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,939
Akira hats but I could talk about more

120
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,710
recent anime that had a profound impact

121
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,990
on anime pop culture if I shouted the

122
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:58,060
phrase and this is to go even further

123
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,310
beyond or just who the hell do you think

124
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,560
I am how many of you would immediately

125
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,630
know what I'm talking about

126
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,520
some classics I feel only has an impact

127
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,980
on the industry some on pop culture and

128
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,689
some doing both but I think it's

129
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,490
important because if an anime hits every

130
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,290
other category but isn't that popular or

131
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:14,880
white

132
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,639
when sure my opinion is closer to a cult

133
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,090
classic and finally number three quality

134
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,980
the term classic surely implies that

135
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,060
there would be a certain level of

136
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,220
quality or critical claim behind it you

137
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,300
can have something that's remained

138
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,949
relevant for years and is also widely

139
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,629
influential as you would see with a lot

140
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,430
of Gateway anime but unless there's a

141
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,230
general agreed consensus that it's up to

142
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,660
a certain level of high standards people

143
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,850
won't take it seriously I think the best

144
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,410
example of this is the sword art online

145
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,000
franchise which is still way more

146
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,220
relevant than arguably any other anime

147
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,689
that came out in the same year and

148
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,639
undoubtedly has had the popularity to

149
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,170
back it up while influencing the

150
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,540
landscape of modern anime but would

151
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,170
anyone actually call this a classic now

152
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,449
with these points in mind how many if

153
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,120
any could you apply all three criteria

154
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:07,560
to an anime today to me it's the feeling

155
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,000
of a modern classic that's been missing

156
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,770
from anime recently and I don't want you

157
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,970
to get the impression that that means

158
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,530
anime has gotten worse quite the

159
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,060
opposite in fact I think it's better

160
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,800
than has ever been and that might

161
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,930
actually be it never before is such a

162
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,000
wide variety of high-quality anime been

163
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,740
available to us in a constant drip feed

164
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,840
of seasonal contents never giving us a

165
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,770
moment's rest

166
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,629
we've been spoilt for choice and the

167
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:28,980
kind of shows when I think this spring

168
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,540
season is kind of weak just because it

169
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,150
only has two shows I'm super hype four

170
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,850
and five shows I think are pretty good

171
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,100
get out what do you mean I'm not

172
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,170
literally spending every free moment

173
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,639
trying to keep up with shows worth

174
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,310
watching like the last two seasons

175
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,910
while they're less shows pioneering new

176
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,528
things which is understandable

177
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,300
considering how all this medium is right

178
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,490
now I think the average quality and very

179
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,528
certainly the quantity of choice has

180
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,569
gone up but that's the thing if

181
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,540
everything special nothing is of order

182
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,759
three criteria it's staying power that

183
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,379
seems to be missing most of the time

184
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,420
current trends and hype series cover the

185
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,040
majority of what remains relevant and

186
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,389
impactful throughout the wider community

187
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,550
with the sheer density of new series

188
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,290
being fed to us every season it can

189
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,079
become easy to forget even great shows

190
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,240
we used to complain that anime used to

191
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,150
have filler seasons now it feels like we

192
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,100
have filler anime you could argue that

193
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,870
is far too early to determine which

194
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,639
recently aired anime has staying power

195
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,949
but I'd argue that you'd be hard-pressed

196
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:32,199
to find any show that lingers around for

197
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,420
longer than three months let alone years

198
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,579
or decades later just because not a lot

199
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:37,930
of time has passed doesn't mean you

200
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,430
can't have a good idea of what will

201
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,110
stick around there are in plenty of

202
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,338
sporting events that have been labeled

203
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,259
an instant classic as soon as the last

204
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,389
episode of Breaking Bad aired I knew was

205
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,189
gonna go down in television history and

206
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,899
with what infinity warned endgame have

207
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,670
achieved and how much is permeated into

208
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,040
general pop culture I have no doubt they

209
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
will become classics that have defined

210
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,610
this generation when a rare occurrence

211
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,528
though I will watch an anime that does

212
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:00,968
something special that would stay in my

213
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:03,160
mind for a very long time even in this

214
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,020
climate something that goes above and

215
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,968
beyond even compared to the best and has

216
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,730
that special x-factor you rarely see the

217
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,800
anime that I would say has come closest

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,810
to becoming a classic recently is mod

219
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,600
psycho 100 season 2 hell I know many of

220
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,009
you would probably argue it already is

221
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,588
and I completely get that season 2 of

222
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,300
mob psycho is one of the best anime

223
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,560
series I've seen in years that

224
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
completely blew the first season out of

225
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
the water if somehow leveled up is

226
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,718
orgasmic animation with some of the best

227
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,310
fight scenes of the last decade and

228
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,870
paired this with a heart and intimate

229
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,069
character writing that wasn't as

230
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,930
prevalent before while ending every

231
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,459
major plot thread it had sets up

232
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:38,319
resulting in an all-round package that

233
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,060
will certainly stick with me for years

234
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,370
to come it was just such a perfect storm

235
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,350
of greatness on every level that you

236
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,740
rarely get to see so what exactly is it

237
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,310
missing

238
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,980
well it's precisely because it's a

239
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,170
season to as much of a masterpiece as I

240
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,699
think it was a lot of people were

241
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,588
dropped off after season 1 which is to

242
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:58,329
be expected in the fast-paced seasonal

243
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,710
anime cycle and an over

244
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,319
two year gap between seasons even I had

245
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,730
trouble remembering everything the first

246
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,350
season left off that and I'm sure this

247
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,490
killed off a lot of the potential

248
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,650
wide-scale impact it could have had I

249
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,660
have no doubts that if it was one long

250
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,879
season or even if the gap was shorter it

251
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,590
would have permeated the community much

252
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,810
deeper than it did but as it stands it

253
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,730
wasn't even the most popular show of its

254
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,620
own season there was more discussion

255
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,660
around shield hero more fresh hype

256
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,220
around promise Netherlands and more

257
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,500
memes around Cali a summer this I think

258
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,540
perfectly illustrates why is so hard for

259
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,040
anime today to get a sense of longevity

260
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,709
right now anime has become too segmented

261
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,000
to have the same influence and the

262
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,620
community moves too fast to have the

263
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,689
same staying power it used to I'm sure

264
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,669
it's still possible it's just much

265
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,829
harder it has to be able to stand up

266
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,449
from the dozens of anime it competes

267
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,189
with every season it has to be given a

268
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:46,659
long enough run time to have a lasting

269
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,549
impact without big breaks if it's broken

270
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,409
up into seasons it has to be easily

271
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,969
accessible on a streaming platform that

272
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,589
the community will collectively access

273
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:56,639
and on top of that it has to be you know

274
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,259
really fucking good I do however think

275
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,209
there's a small asterisk to this point

276
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,009
as I think every generation will have a

277
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,809
long-running shown in that defines that

278
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,120
era and goes down as a classic will

279
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,859
there being a staple of gateway anime

280
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,449
and this long-running nature allows it

281
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,250
far more time to build the popularity

282
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,949
and impact and staying power cuz well it

283
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,899
sticks around for so long so if there is

284
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,699
an exception to everything I've said

285
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,549
here it would of course be my hero

286
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,859
academia I do think this is the one show

287
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,389
that has done enough to be remembered

288
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,949
for a long time to come but I also

289
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,899
consider these types of shows to play by

290
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,219
a different set of rules than the mob

291
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,169
psychos of the anime world because part

292
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,819
of the reason the idea of classics has

293
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,459
died is because well we don't feel the

294
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,589
need to look back into the past even if

295
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,269
the past is just a year or two ago

296
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,039
there's so much to choose from now

297
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,439
what's the point of looking back and

298
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,779
thus the real reason I wanted to make

299
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,879
this video because over the past P month

300
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,649
I actually did set a bit of time to

301
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,179
watch some classic anime I had never

302
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,370
seen before and it just reminded me why

303
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,439
classics are indeed called classics

304
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,039
[Music]

305
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,899
two months ago I set off on an arduous

306
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,759
mission to start the anime that had been

307
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,649
sitting on my watch list for years

308
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,599
waiting until I was ready to take that

309
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,750
leap of faith to finally watch it legend

310
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,909
of the Galactic Heroes it was an

311
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,589
undertaking that was as intimidating as

312
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,240
the reputation that preceded it a

313
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,099
classic so highly spoken of has

314
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,809
literally been memed to death by many

315
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,089
people myself included as the one show

316
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,319
that's been put up on the highest

317
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,409
pedestal anime won't be the same once

318
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,969
you watched legends of the Galactic

319
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,519
Heroes they said and with this all in

320
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,299
mind what I found was exactly what I had

321
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,899
expected one of the greatest stories to

322
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,479
have been told in the history of anime a

323
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,089
tale so grand no other anime even comes

324
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:48,579
close to the scale depth and density of

325
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,829
the saga told here a production that

326
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,269
took almost ten years to complete

327
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,789
contained in a whopping 110 episodes for

328
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,679
a one-of-a-kind experience you can't

329
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,870
find anywhere else in this medium it's

330
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,549
not the kind of fast-paced instant

331
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,409
gratification anime more common today

332
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,539
but a full-length epic you gradually

333
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,609
immerse yourself into with a show like

334
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,409
this you can get so caught up in its

335
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,990
reputation that it can be easy to forget

336
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,809
how and why you've got its reputation in

337
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,909
the first place through this it reminded

338
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,099
me why there used to be this big notion

339
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,479
that you should go out and watch the

340
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,609
classics not just because it was a great

341
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:23,469
show there are plenty of great shows

342
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,149
that are coming out right now but

343
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,949
because it's a unique experience from

344
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,259
anything you can find today there's a

345
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,209
reason the classics have survived the

346
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,949
passage of time they might have

347
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,870
pioneered something they might have left

348
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,759
a deep impression on the audience of

349
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,679
their time but most importantly it's

350
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,329
because throughout the years that came

351
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:43,329
after nothing came along that was able

352
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,879
to replace them I can safely say since I

353
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,649
first watched Cowboy Bebop

354
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,659
there hasn't been any other show quite

355
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,789
like it serial experiments lain has a

356
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,229
depiction of technology that somehow

357
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,449
seems more relevant today than when it

358
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,479
came out in 1998 akira still looks

359
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,549
better than 90% of the anime coming out

360
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,250
now beyond genesis evangelion redefines

361
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,009
what it means to be zon refining it can

362
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,779
be easy to get through the currency of

363
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,479
ISA Kuip our fantasy highschool rom-coms

364
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,899
of today that

365
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,748
may didn't always look like this so if

366
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:16,549
you think this season is little slow and

367
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,198
you have some time to fill just pick a

368
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,758
classic title that's been collecting

369
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,128
dust on your watch list and I guarantee

370
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,719
it'll be a way more fulfilling

371
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,549
experience than watching another

372
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,409
disposable show that's been airing in

373
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,969
the last year whether or not you agree

374
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:31,789
on which anime houses classics or even

375
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,438
if you disagree with my opinion that we

376
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,299
haven't gotten any recently I think it's

377
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,068
important to keep the idea of classics

378
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,748
alive because it does feel like lately

379
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,549
there's been a depreciation in the value

380
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,240
of longevity and revisiting the past so

381
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,769
if there's anything I wanted to do with

382
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,808
this video it's reminding people that

383
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,998
there is a reason to look back it's

384
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:51,979
taking a break from the current climate

385
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,299
and having a look at a product of

386
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,859
another time it's having that

387
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:58,248
realization of oh this is what everyone

388
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:00,349
was talking about it's experiencing a

389
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,389
show that has done something to deserve

390
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:04,490
to be remembered because one of the

391
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,198
saddest things I think it happened to

392
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,850
classics is for them to be forgotten

393
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,678
