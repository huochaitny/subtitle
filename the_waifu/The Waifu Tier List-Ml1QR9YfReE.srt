00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,958
hey guys Giga here with another useless

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:03,428
video so have you been hanging around

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,078
YouTube or Twitter you may have seen

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:06,969
these tearless pop-up I don't know you

5
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:08,649
might have missed them only about two

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:09,970
people have done it at this point it's

7
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,370
pretty new but while we have fast foods

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,130
and presidents and youtubers where is

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,620
the tier list us weaves really care

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,150
about that's right so today I'll be

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,499
taking some of the most popular female

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,390
characters I can find on my anime list

13
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,519
some relevant seasonal ones and just a

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,199
few wild cards for good measure of

15
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,879
course someone like me who has immersed

16
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,128
himself in a study of waifu ology i will

17
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,169
persevere to give the most objective

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,509
impartial list that will leave out all

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,649
my personal biases you could have seen

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,128
that coming

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,479
but I mean starting with my literal

22
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,128
goddess would be a bit unfair so you

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,599
know if there was one character that

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,459
could set the baseline for this list it

25
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,890
would be Ozma if there was a game a girl

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,640
of waifu's she would be it hell she is a

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,619
game a girl this is kind of as basic an

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,119
anime girl as you can get it's like

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,559
starting a new game and in the character

30
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,238
creation screen you picked the default

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,950
character model and don't edit any of

32
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,539
the base stats her only outstanding

33
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,369
feature is the fact that she doesn't

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,709
have any outstanding features detail

35
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,629
Shinobu anime has garnered this

36
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,399
uncomfortable reputation of having these

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,049
characters that look suspiciously young

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,909
actually be obscenely old and mature of

39
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,649
vampires or demon Lords trapped in a

40
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,149
younger body only those with an

41
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,859
untrained eye will fail to recognize

42
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,099
that Shinobu is clearly 598 years old

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,959
and that's why cultured men like ass can

44
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,759
put her 80 and not feel weird about

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,599
anything at all cuz we don't this is

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,409
normal I swear to god your honor zero -

47
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,329
here's the prime example of a girl who

48
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,230
has topped the charts from the

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,209
aesthetics quality while forgetting to

50
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,679
put any of the stats back into the

51
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,418
character if we were going by design

52
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,159
alone she would have easily been best

53
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,378
girl of 2018 she's got the unique look

54
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,480
the unique quirks I'm pretty sure she's

55
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,890
the only waifu that can claim to be a

56
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,509
spaceship but it says a lot about how

57
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:56,980
strong these traits are wishing can go

58
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,808
from crazy murderous rampage to

59
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,549
non-existent character and still be best

60
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,778
curling your shows that we haven't

61
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,149
forgotten be tear a car made from a car

62
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,099
mega kill more like edgy enough to make

63
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,539
me a calm and go kill myself

64
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,490
Ichigo now Ichigo gets a lot of hate for

65
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,280
having the audacity to complete

66
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,618
but I think she has some positives going

67
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:15,719
for her I mean just imagine waking up to

68
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,429
this face next to you every morning and

69
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:19,770
personally I can't think of a better way

70
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,800
to start my day because then I already

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,060
know the day couldn't get any worse

72
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,340
black hole Chan this is what happens

73
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,689
when you take any kind of monumental

74
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,819
scientific achievement and give it to

75
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,560
the anomie community to completely ruin

76
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,390
here we have a girl who has the massive

77
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,360
6.5 billion suns concentrated into a

78
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,340
point so dense it has a gravitational

79
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,930
pull that can physically distort

80
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,849
space-time so you can see what's so

81
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:43,618
special about black hole challenge she's

82
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,689
very much into four she loves war this

83
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,730
is war personally I think we found a new

84
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,770
fetish of a girl that'll suck so hard

85
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,300
even after you nuts

86
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,520
she'll just keep sucking until every

87
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,680
atom that makes you up gets ripped apart

88
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:02,460
at a subatomic level why tear Evangelion

89
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,289
girls you've got to pay respect to the

90
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,509
classics and Oscar is a true OG that

91
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,580
holds a close place in my teenage heart

92
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,469
she pioneered cinder days and there are

93
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,240
a few even today that can hold a candle

94
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,160
to her they say you'd never forget your

95
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,770
first but as you grow older you move on

96
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,560
and become wiser some say you realize

97
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,789
you're an adult when you start taking

98
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,200
responsibility for your own actions

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,170
however the true sign of adulthood is

100
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,819
when you live there's an ask a kind of

101
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,560
kids only to grow up and realize that

102
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,750
you've become a mossad oh man ray though

103
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,670
still remains the AVA girl equivalent of

104
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,110
stepping in a wet pile of wood socks on

105
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,270
ram now i know i've memed up ram a lot

106
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:37,680
but even i can see how she got the

107
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,599
popularity that she did I mean she's a

108
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,368
sweetheart she sticks with you and

109
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:42,990
she'll lift you up during your darkest

110
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,330
times so right here I think she should

111
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,890
get a bit of the recognition that she

112
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,479
deserves

113
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,189
well Hinata I got to be honest I'm not

114
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:53,179
the biggest fan of this character

115
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:55,610
archetype the shy lovestruck girl that

116
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,810
only comes out there she'll to the

117
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,550
person they like I think the technical

118
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,610
term is dander eh but I much prefer the

119
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,770
term doormat however I have to give a

120
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:05,090
credit because she is one of the only

121
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,310
short bluehead anime girl that has ever

122
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,110
ended up with the guy they liked because

123
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,209
she persevered and was true to her

124
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:12,980
feelings and protected her love in the

125
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,469
hardest of times and most importantly

126
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,480
she grew Hera proving that all the

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,360
doormats can dream of one day growing up

128
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,968
to become carpet Oh Chico from my hero

129
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:25,699
academia Oh Chico is a good hard-working

130
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,410
girl all she wants to do is to make

131
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,790
money so she can take care of her

132
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,100
parents how straightforward is that she

133
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,020
is the definition of a pure cinnamon

134
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,910
roll and that's why I'm gonna put her in

135
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,040
the Panera bread's here megameter de

136
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,960
couro she's like Oh Chico but just not

137
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,270
as refined a pastry and what's a less

138
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,490
elegant cinnamon roll that's right

139
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,370
a sausage roll Greg's tier Hina and Rui

140
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,139
winter seasons domestic girlfriend

141
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,610
really put to test the eternal battle

142
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,460
and why food trash emoto's vs. oh nice

143
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,819
Emma's little sis vs big sis onii-chan

144
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,050
vs ara ara

145
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,699
whatever your preference don't forget

146
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,439
the die-hard rule to live by when

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,410
talking about siblings in anime if she's

148
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,230
not blood-related she's free to be dated

149
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,319
see Tia Jabbar me you Mako I once said

150
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,509
don't stick your dick in crazy and

151
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,939
Jabbar me is fuckin crazy any sane

152
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,860
person can see that so any guy could

153
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,300
actually try something with her would

154
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,829
obviously only be able to think with

155
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,770
their dicks fortunately my dick has an

156
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,210
IQ of 200

157
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,430
senko son Sanka son takes up the role of

158
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,810
seasonal why for you that you end up

159
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,040
seeing everywhere because of their

160
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,259
reaction faces you got the power face

161
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,240
she got the blood face and you've got

162
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,120
the holy grail of all anime reaction

163
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:43,579
faces the I got the smug face this makes

164
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,230
them a prime target family profile

165
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,550
pictures because they can make people

166
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,620
think that they embody the spirit of a

167
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,838
cute anime girl not realizing that it

168
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:52,278
doesn't actually mask over their

169
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,350
degeneracy and anything they say online

170
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,088
will now never be taken seriously

171
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,588
however these girls are only really a

172
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,540
strong pick until the season ends at

173
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,250
which point they then get immediately

174
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:02,420
disposed of

175
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,910
dear and I'm next week

176
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:12,139
[Music]

177
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,020
[Applause]

178
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,970
this is what a true waifu goddess looks

179
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,009
like and with that evolution her stats

180
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,620
have totally put her up into st r sagar

181
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,230
e okay let me be real for a second i owe

182
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,170
a lot to Sakurai and I know I said I

183
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,180
would stay unbiased but in the end era

184
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,069
manga sensei was one of my first big

185
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,960
memes that got me quite popular and

186
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Sagar II was right in the middle of that

187
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,910
so FBI memes aside on a personal level

188
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,670
there's only one place I could really

189
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,020
put her how her he Suzumiya imagine

190
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,879
being so desperate for friends that the

191
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,860
only reason anyone hangs out you is to

192
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,810
prevent the fucking apocalypse chika

193
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,550
this is the closest thing in anime you'd

194
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,230
find to a drug addiction if you're

195
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,850
having a bad day you just inject this

196
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,410
shit right into your veins and for a

197
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,939
moment it can make you forget about the

198
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:00,620
drudging monotony that is your life

199
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,540
despite being a seasonal go I think

200
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,069
she's left a strong enough impression to

201
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,379
be beat here Mari from me to darkest a

202
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,819
key

203
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,468
rin tohsaka rin will always be one of

204
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,480
the greats because to me rain involves

205
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,310
the highest quality at tsundere can be

206
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,250
while still being a pure tsundere some

207
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,050
of these top tier girls have sin traits

208
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,759
and sin moments that are blended with

209
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,920
other things but Rin isn't out-and-out

210
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,870
tsundere that manages to differentiate

211
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,670
herself from the rest she is what

212
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,650
happens when every tinder date rate is

213
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,689
refined to the highest degree she has

214
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,550
the twin tails she has the thigh-highs

215
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,259
she has the blush I'd literally die in

216
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,968
reincarnate into another world to

217
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:44,218
protect and the mix between sin and dead

218
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:45,930
a so perfectly balanced

219
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,189
she alone could have been the most

220
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,139
effective weapon against thanasis now

221
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,650
sto calorie spoilers for your line April

222
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,778
you know how an anime characters will

223
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:56,460
stereotypically wait for like two

224
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,350
seasons before holding hand and like

225
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,750
five years to confess well Carrie here

226
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,730
is so extra in our patience to let her

227
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,500
true feelings known that by the time she

228
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,740
decided to confess she was fuckin dead

229
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:12,180
she gets a D for deceased departed done

230
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,930
for dominatrix Speedwagon every so often

231
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,699
you come across someone that has it all

232
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,129
the looks the charm the loyalty

233
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,650
Speedwagon embodies everything a waifu

234
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,569
should be and more but i know what

235
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,520
you're thinking how can this 200-pound

236
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,129
hunk of pure man meat count as a waifu

237
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:31,620
and that's so short-sighted because you

238
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,069
fail to see that wife wisdom is in the

239
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,289
heart here's a bro that will give you

240
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,419
the devotion you deserve more than any

241
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,149
other waifu kirk he will never leave you

242
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,179
he isn't gay he simply ran out of women

243
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,919
that were worthy

244
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,309
like Speedwagon what kind of man doesn't

245
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:54,620
easily an sto and that was pretty much

246
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,448
